<h1>HANNIBAL - THE BATTLE OF CANNAE</h1>
<p>
After defeating the Romans at the Battle of Lake Trasimene,
Hannibal now moved his forces down south.  There was panic
in Rome and Quintus Fabius Maximus was appointed dictator 
to deal with Hannibal.  Fabius, however, refused to meet 
Hannibal in the open field and this strategy became highly
unpopular in Rome.  Romans were used to attacking, not hiding.
The Romans were forced to go on the offensive after Hannibal
positioned his forces betweeen Rome and it's vital grain supply.
This setup the epic Battle of Cannae.  Here Hannibal
defeated the Romans inflicting the worst single day defeat in Rome's
history.
</p>

<h1>AFTERMATH OF THE BATTLE OF CANNAE</h1>
<p>
After the horrific defeat at the Battle of Cannae, the Romans
reinstituted Fabius' avoidance strategy.  The Romans no longer
refused to meet Hannibal in head on collisons.  Rather the Roman
army kept a watchful eye on Hannibal, but always at a close distance.
</p>

<p>The avoidance strategy worked but it took forever.  It took almost 
two long decades to drive Hannibal out of Italy.  And even then Hannibal
was never defeated in Italy.  The Romans, adopting a tactic out of 
Hannibal's playbook, launched an attack against Carthage itself.
This forced Hannibal to travel back to Africa to defend the city.
Here he was defeated at the Battle of Zama.

<h1>Archaic (Early Dynastic) Period (c. 3100-2686 B.C.)</h2>
<p> King Menes founded the capital of ancient Egypt at White Walls
(later known as Memphis), in the north, near the apex of the Nile
River delta. The capital would grow into a great metropolis that 
dominated Egyptian society during the Old Kingdom period. The Archaic
Period saw the development of the foundations of Egyptian society,
including the all-important ideology of kingship. To the ancient 
Egyptians, the king was a godlike being, closely identified with 
the all-powerful god Horus. The earliest known hieroglyphic writing
also dates to this period.
</p>

<h1>Early Dynastic Period (c. 3050â€“2686 BC)</h1>
<p>The Early Dynastic Period was approximately contemporary to the
early Sumerian-Akkadian civilisation of Mesopotamia and of ancient
Elam. The third-century BC Egyptian priest Manetho grouped the long
line of kings from Menes to his own time into 30 dynasties, a system
still used today. He began his official history with the king named 
"Meni" (or Menes in Greek) who was believed to have united the two 
kingdoms of Upper and Lower Egypt.[20]
The Narmer Palette depicts the unification of the Two Lands.
The transition to a unified state happened more gradually than 
ancient Egyptian writers represented, and there is no contemporary 
record of Menes. Some scholars now believe, however, that the mythical
Menes may have been the king Narmer, who is depicted wearing royal 
regalia on the ceremonial Narmer Palette, in a symbolic act of unification.
